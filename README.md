# Half-Atwood Machine Simulator
Half-Atwood Machine Simulator for web browser using p5.js

It includes:
- Inertia from pulley (determined by mass and radius);
- Static and kinetic friction on horizontally moving block.

Notes:
- The canvas width is 3 m.
- The static friction coefficient must greater or equal to the kinetic friction coefficient. This is hardcoded in the simulator;
- The radius of the pulley must be in the interval 0.01-0.12m. This is to avoid objects getting out of the canvas or getting too small.
- Decimals must include a '.'. Comma are not recognized.

To do:
- Nothing for now
